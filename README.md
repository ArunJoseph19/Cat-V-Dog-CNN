# Cats & Dogs CNN Classifer
#Project-0

Hi, My name is Arun Joseph and this repo is home to a simple Convolutional Neural Network Classifier.

It primarily classifies Dogs and Cat, although you can try predicting how cat/dog-like you are.

Flask has been implemented, therefor you can run this project on 'http://localhost:5000/' to see a simple output of an image and it's respective prediction.

This project has been done according to the [Udemy course](https://www.udemy.com/course/machinelearning/).
